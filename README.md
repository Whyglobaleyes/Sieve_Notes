# Sieve_Notes
Some help-notes for writing Sieve filters: would be great to find a working tool/ GUI for this or Geany Syntax highlighting



## Sieve
A language/ protocol used by email servers specifying `filters` to be applied to email messages that are then `filed`/ `actioned` .


## General Syntax

#### Comments
Either bash-script `# hash symbol` or PHP-style `/* this is a comment, can be multiline */` comments are allowed .

#### Shebang
Every SieveFile starts with a first line of `require ["fileinto", "reject"];`
